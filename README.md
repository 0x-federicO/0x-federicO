# A few key _points_

* have a **crush** on programming & languages, for that I know/use a few of them !
* delivering j2ee devOps - data engineering and fullstack web projects since around 2k.
* prefer "composition" over "ihneritance" - and know some "patterns @ large" -
* like to apply new tech. things, and I am _specifically_ keen on Agile/Lean methodologies, plus TDD/BDD -
* usually _quite_ busy, though - these days I tend to _focus_ on Go, rust and Clj -
