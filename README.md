## About

Working in the IT industry, mostly as programmer/dev since around 2k.

I applied a few programming languages, including php, Java, scala, Perl (once! and for data/logs analytics) and JS (front-end/fullstack).

I had the chance to work on 24x7, devOps (j2ee) and big-data projects @ work, so I am used to take charge of diverse tech. duties.

Nevertheless, I continue learning new things, and I am keen on Agile/Lean methodologies.

#### Here

Actually, there were _good intentions_ to publish a few projects/artifacts over here (eg. CLI tools/apps), anyway this sadly means "*on-hold-for-a-while*" -

So, check it back, every now and then !

#### Professional interest

* front-end UI/UX - fullstack, python/js -
* Rust/go
