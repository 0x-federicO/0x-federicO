## To keep it short !

- At the moment, I have a few work duties ongoing
- I am usually programming for the Web, using JS, php or Python -
- I can also **do** IaC, data engineering, eg. big-data + related specific *Ops -

### Languages

- [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - lightweight, w/ first-class functions !
- [Scala](scala-lang.org/) - object-oriented and functional, yet very concise -
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) - concurrency +fun @ scale !
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - a functional programming language, seemless Java interop -

### A few _topics of interest_ - for duties' sake !

These things, are what I am _exploring_ (thus, also evaluating) - since - 2018/19, and that - for my own _professional_ tech. **culture**:

- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) - The Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust ! ü§ñ
- [ELM](https://elm-lang.org/) - A delightful language for reliable web applications. üåÖ
- [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/) - Simple, fast and quality type safe code, using _JS_ and _OCaml_ ‚õîÔ∏è

### A few _personal_ projects -

- <a href="https://overtone.github.io">Overtone</a> +Clj - collaborative music production üé∂
- I am _rewriting_ a few GNU tools for parallel, +OpenMP (eg. <a href="https://theboostcpplibraries.com/parallel-programming">Boost.MPI</a>) üí®

Also, I occasionally _publish_ a few [Gists](https://gists.github.com/0xlz5), usually complex "_scripts_", and I maintain a Tech. [BLOG](high-order-coding.tumblr.com/) about functional, scripting and HPC üèÆ

That's it !
