## Key facts

* I am keen on programming languages, for that I know a few of them, including scala, Go and Clj - GNU and "code security" 
* I "delivered" to a few java/JS (devOps), big-data and 24x7 web projects, in the past couple decades
* I like - and applied - Agile and Lean methodologies, eg. SCRUM -
* I have a specialty in Perl (not only scripting) and functional programming -
* I think IT/CS is going to change a lot fwd/backward, which is quite "weird" and strange, eheh

Here you have some simple scripting code, organized in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/0x-repo) 🏮

## Nice things ongoing (to come, todo)

* Since a a few months, working on the rewrite of a few GNU tools for "parallel" +OpenMPI using Go and/or Rust -
* Have been _noodling_ with Clj and [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) -
* Also, I am going to review/publish some workflow tools useful for TUMBLR tech. blogging -
* What else !?
