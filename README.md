Hi !

This repo, is intended to _give_ you a _brief_ insight into my professional profile +interests,
mostly 24X7 | Web

- at first, a good share of [details](./__01.md) - 👨🏻‍💻
- then, a list of my _professional_ key points, +competence [domains](./__02.md) 👈

I _basically_ like a lot dynamic languages (eg. scripting), code. opt and *Ops tools +methodology (eg. DevOps).
Also, I can count a valuable big-dta (+analytics) experience.

These days, I am "truly" focused on Web and 2xd7 tech. - JS, php and functional programing +OOP. 

Cheers,
