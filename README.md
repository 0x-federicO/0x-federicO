Hi there, here's a software dev & data engineer dev based in Italy-

There were actually good plans to publish some interesting _CLI_ projects of mine over here,
based on some widely used command line GNU tools, anyway this *sadly* means "**on/hold/for/a/while**" -

check it back, soon in the future !
