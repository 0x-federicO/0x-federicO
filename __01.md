## To keep it simple.

- At the moment, I have a _few_ work duties ongoing - 
- I am usually programming for the Web, using JS, php or Python -
- I can also **do** IaC, data engineering, eg. big-data + related specific *Ops -

### Languages

- [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - lightweight, w/ first-class functions !
- [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) - object-oriented and functional, yet very concise -
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) - concurrency +fun @ scale !
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - a functional programming language, seamless Java interop -


Also, I occasionally _publish_ a few [Gists](https://gists.github.com/0xlz5), usually "_tricky_" scripts, and I publish to a tech. [Blog](https://high-order-coding.tumblr.com/) about functional, scripting and HPC

üèÆ

That's it !
