## To keep it simple.

- At the moment, I have a _few_ work duties ongoing - and, as usual been _updating_ üôÉ
- I am _focused_ on programming for the Web, (_mostly_) using JS, php and/or Python + related frameworks.
- I can also **do** yaml/IaC, data engineering, eg. big-data + related specific *Ops -

### A _few_ languages (_i currenty support in 24x7 prod systems_)

- [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - lightweight, w/ first-class functions !
- [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) - object-oriented and functional, yet very concise -
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) - concurrency +fun @ scale !

Also, I occasionally _publish_ a few [Gists](https://gists.github.com/0xlz5), usually "_tricky_" scripts, and I publish to a tech. [Blog](https://high-order-coding.tumblr.com/) about functional, scripting and *HPC*

### Here, a _few_ Open Source projects, that I _like_
- [NFStream](https://github.com/nfstream/nfstream) - a Flexible Network Data Analysis Framework. 
- [ngrep](https://github.com/jpr5/ngrep) - _quite_ like GNU grep applied to the network layer; it's PCAP-based
- [Backbone.js](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) - supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy apps
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development


üèÆ

That's it !
