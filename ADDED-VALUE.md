Here a few **professional** interests, that I already **applied** and/or I am applying in dev/prod environments -

### Languages

- [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - lightweight, w/ first-class functions !
- [Scala](scala-lang.org/) - object-oriented and functional, yet very concise -
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) - concurrency +fun @ scale !
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - a functional programming language, seemless Java interop - 🖌

### A few _topics I like_ - actually related to duties' sake !

These is what I am just _exploring_ (thus, also evaluating) - since - 2018/19, and that - for my own _professional_ tech. **culture**:

- [ELM](https://elm-lang.org/) - A delightful language for reliable web applications. 🌅
- [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/) - Simple, fast and quality type safe code, using _JS_ and _OCaml_ ⛔️
- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) - The Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust ! 🤖
