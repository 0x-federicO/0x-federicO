# Here a few **professional** interests, that I already **applied** and/or I am applying in dev (+prod) environments -

## Languages

- [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - lightweight, w/ first-class functions !
- [Scala](scala-lang.org/) - object-oriented and functional, yet very concise -
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) - concurrency +fun @ scale !
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - a functional programming language, seemless Java interop - 🖌

## A few _topics I like_ - actually related to work duties' sake !

These is what I am just _exploring_ (thus, also evaluating) - since - 2018/19, and that - for my own _professional_ tech. **culture**:

- [ELM](https://elm-lang.org/) - A delightful language for reliable web applications. 🌅
- [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/) - Simple, fast and quality type safe code, using _JS_ and _OCaml_ ⛔️
- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) - The Dark Arts of "Unsafe" Rust ! 🤖

## A few _personal_ projects (ongoing/todo) -

- I am _rewriting_ a few GNU tools for parallel, +OpenMP (eg. <a href="https://theboostcpplibraries.com/parallel-programming">Boost.MPI</a>) 💨
- <a href="https://overtone.github.io">Overtone</a> +Clj - collaborative music production 🎶

That's it -
